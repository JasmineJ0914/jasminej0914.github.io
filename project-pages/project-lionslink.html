        <div class="body-text">LionsLink is an app concept developed to bridge the gap between Emerson College graduate students and campus life. Recognizing the challenges graduate students face, like off-campus living and irregular schedules, this app is designed to make event discovery, networking, and community-building more accessible. Beyond just event listings, LionsLink provides a platform for students to connect, share resources, and stay informed about academic, networking, and recreational opportunities.
