        <div class="main-title">Community Story Table – Bridging the Gap Between College Students and Boston's Chinatown</div>
        <div class="body-text">The Community Story Table was born from my experiences as a Chinese international student and conversations with peers who shared a sense of disconnect from Boston's Chinatown. Despite the physical proximity of Emerson College and other institutions to Chinatown, many students feel like outsiders in a community that should feel like home. This project seeks to address the gap in engagement, especially among young people aged 17 to 24, a demographic that now makes up a significant portion of Chinatown’s residents.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Research Insights:<br>
          Through interviews and research, several key findings emerged:
          <ul>
          <li>While Chinatown has initiatives to engage youth, there is a lack of targeted efforts for college students.</li>
          <li>Many students struggle to connect with the community due to limited knowledge of Chinatown’s history and culture.</li>
          <li>Although Chinatown is rich with cultural stories and historical resources, these are often not accessible or visible to newcomers.</li>
          <li>Local restaurants and businesses serve as primary interaction points but often do not foster lasting connections.</li>
        </ul></div>
          <div class="body-text"> The Community Story Table <br>
            To address these challenges, I developed the Community Story Table, an intervention set up in local Chinatown restaurants. The concept operates on two levels:<br>
            <b>Physical Table</b>
            The physical setup consists of a dining table in a Chinatown restaurant, displaying printed materials like historical images and brief descriptions of the neighborhood’s history. Each table features a QR code that leads visitors to the digital counterpart of the Community Story Table, encouraging diners to explore more in-depth stories. <br>
            <b>Digital Table</b>
            The digital version offers links to stories about Chinatown’s history and connections to local organizations and events, helping visitors stay informed about current community activities. A digital whiteboard, accessible via Miro, allows users to leave messages, share their reflections, or even add their own stories, creating a sense of belonging and contribution to Chinatown’s evolving narrative.
